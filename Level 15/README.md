### SOLUTION
 
### Right click on the web page to "View Page Source"

	...
	Since you still have your photoshop open, check this out: <a href="images/pass2level16.jpg">images/pass2level16.jpg</a>
	...

> The page suggests you download `<img src="images/pass2level16.jpg`.

> But, when you open this image its says it cannot be opened.

> Open the file in a hex editor tells you the file is a .JFIF which is JPEG File Interchange Format.

>




This is because it is a `.gif` file. Rename the file as pass2level16.gif and open it.

> Download this .gif and open with an image editor such as GIMP.

> The .gif image says `TOTALLY!!! PHP`.
