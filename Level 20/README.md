### SOLUTION

> There are 2 long digits on the screen.

## The first is a hex number:
436f6e67726174756c6174696f6e732532312b596f752b686176652b7061737365642b746f2b6c6576656c2b31302e2b486572652532432b7468696e67732b6265636f6d652b6d7563682b6d6f72652b6469666663756c742b2533422d2532395b486f70652b796f752b6765742b7468726f7567682532312b456e6a6f792e

> Open a Hex to ASCII converter: www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html

> This converts the message to:
`Congratulations%21+You+have+passed+to+level+10.+Here%2C+things+become+much+more+diffcult+%3B-%29[Hope+you+get+through%21+Enjoy.`

> This does not seem to tell you much.

## The second is a Base64 number:

> Decode this as base 64, 4 times to reveal:
	Go to www.streetkorner.net/gb now.

> In the source code below this Base64 number is 
	<font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^ Change domain, add "22332" at the end, reach it and then get hold of ... ^^^^^^^^^^
	</font>
	
> This suggests the next URL is www.streetkorner.net/gb22332

> However, opening this link directs you to a page that wants to install a safe browser extension. This looks a tad dodgy, so I guess the journey ends here.

> One day I might open this URL in a Virtual Machine to see where it leads.
